I interpreted and implemented my teammate’s “Marie Cuisine” idea by starting from her one-sentence goal and core features and then translating them into concrete layouts and interactions. Instead of changing the concept, I tried to preserve the cozy, Martha-Stewart-inspired feel through a clean homepage with a hero banner, soft colors, and recipe cards, plus dedicated pages for recipes, individual recipe detail, and an About page that tells the story behind the site. When I had to make design or technical decisions that weren’t fully specified in the PRD, I tried to ask myself, “Does this still feel warm, approachable, and timeless?” and used that as my filter.

The main challenges in development and collaboration were about scope and alignment. On the development side, it took time to break the PRD into manageable pieces like reusable recipe cards, navigation, and a simple favorites feature that worked with local storage instead of a full backend. On the collaboration side, it was sometimes hard to interpret vague ideas around “cozy aesthetic” or “timeless” into specific fonts, colors, and layouts, so we had to iterate and check in to make sure what I built actually matched the original vision. Coordinating small details like naming conventions and file structure also mattered more than I expected, because it affected how easily others could understand or extend the code.

I used AI tools mainly for implementation support rather than idea generation. For example, I asked AI to help draft starter HTML structures for the recipe cards and layout, to suggest vanilla JavaScript snippets for the search bar and favorites feature using localStorage, and to debug small issues when my event listeners or filters were not working as expected. I also used AI to refine the wording for the About page so it matched the “Martha-Stewart-inspired but approachable” tone. From this, I learned that AI is very helpful for unblocking specific technical or wording problems, but I still need to understand the code well enough to adapt it, simplify it to match our class standards, and make sure it fits the original product vision rather than just copying whatever the tool outputs.
